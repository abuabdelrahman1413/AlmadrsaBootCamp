HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three basic technologies used to create contemporary webpages and online apps. These are the web's languages.

Let's concentrate on HTML in this article. We'll go through what HTML is and why you should learn it as well.

What is HTML?

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's a markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming language).

Paragraphs, links, headers, pictures, video, and other sorts of content are all described using HTML elements. HTML is understood by web browsers, which render HTML code as webpages.

In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:

The opening tag
The closing tag
The actual element
You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.
